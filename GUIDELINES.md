# General guidelines for adding bots to sessionbots.directory

While it's technically possible to create any bot you want with [session-nodejs-bot](https://github.com/VityaSchel/session-nodejs-bot) tool or any other library, and you will be responsible for any damages and content shared with it, sessionbots.directory does not allow any bots with dubious and illegal content.

## 1. No illegal content and hatespeech

We do not tolerate any harmful, illegal, discriminative and hate speech bots and these bots will be removed from the website.

This includes, but not limited to: any kind of porn and adult content whatsover, marketplaces that sell illegal things or things that require person verification (such as guns or drugs), bots that spread misinformation, doxxing, links to websites, communities and groups that share any kind of similar topics.

**General idea: if it's allowed in any other messenger and you can proudly show it to your grandma, it's probably fine**

## 2. All bots must be public

This means that your bot must respond to all people who send message to it, without filtering by SessionID or code phrases. You may add additional functionality and paid features to it, but most features should be available to everyone for free.

## 3. All bots must be online 100% of time

This means that your bot must be online anytime and it will be tested randomly by our automated uptime checker. This doesn't mean your bot must technically have 100% uptime, because we won't test it heavily each minute, but if your bot is constantly lacks responses to automatic checks, it first goes to "offline" category and if it never starts responding, it will eventually be hidden from the website.

## Important notice

Please note, that we may remove any content (accounts, bots) from this website without notice if asked by authorities, copyright holders and pretty much everyone else. Though, as it was previously stated, we do not collect any personal information about users and thus won't be able to assist in any investigations involving Session bots.
